## 1. Introduction to Modern System Design

System design is about **building large-scale systems** that meet both functional and non-functional requirements.

### Key Concepts
- **Components & Integration:** Define modules, APIs, and data flows.
- **Scalability & Performance:** Apply networking, parallelism, and distributed systems principles.
- **Complexity Management:** Distributed systems scale naturally but introduce complexity; system design tames it.

### Goals of a Good System
- **Reliable:** Handles failures and errors gracefully.
- **Effective:** Meets user and business needs consistently.
- **Maintainable:** Flexible, easy to scale, and simple to extend with new features.
